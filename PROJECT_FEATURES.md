This feature allows every alert generated by the system to be securely stored in an alert history database with complete information such as alert details, severity level, date and time, recipients, and resolution status. This centralized alert history helps in reviewing past incidents, analyzing recurring issues, performing audits, tracking system behavior over time, and supporting future improvements in safety and performance.

## T-14:  Implement Technician-Focused Maintenance and Fault Alerts
## F-14:  Implement Technician-Focused Maintenance and Fault Alerts
This feature allows technicians to receive dedicated alerts specifically related to equipment, device, or sensor issues so they can take timely corrective action. These alerts notify technicians about potential failures, abnormal device behavior, calibration needs, or maintenance requirements, helping them resolve technical problems quickly, reduce downtime, and keep the system stable and reliable.
