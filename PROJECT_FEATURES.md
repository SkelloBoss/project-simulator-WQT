# Implemented Features
## F-26: User Role Management
 This feature allows the Admin to control and manage user roles within the system. The admin can promote users to higher roles, demote them to lower access levels, or deactivate accounts when necessary, ensuring proper access control, security, and efficient system administration.
## F-11: Implement real-time sensor data collection (pH, turbidity, temperature)
This feature allows the system to automatically collect live data from pH, turbidity, and temperature sensors. The data is updated continuously without manual input. It ensures users always see the most recent water quality information.
## F-16: Implement Real-Time Automatic Alert Generation 
This feature allows the system to continuously track all critical parameters and automatically trigger alerts whenever any value crosses its predefined safe threshold. Users do not need to constantly monitor data manually because the system continuously watches all readings and immediately raises alerts whenever an abnormal or risky condition is detected. This ensures early warning, faster decision-making, and improved system safety.
