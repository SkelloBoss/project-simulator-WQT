## F-17:Implement Multi-Channel Alert Notification Delivery 
This feature allows alerts to reach users instantly through multiple communication channels so important notifications are never missed. When an alert is generated, the system can notify relevant users through email, SMS, and clear dashboard pop-up messages. Each notification clearly communicates what happened, which parameter caused the alert, and its severity, ensuring users receive timely and reliable information from wherever they are.
