## F-17:Implement Multi-Channel Alert Notification Delivery 
This feature allows alerts to reach users instantly through multiple communication channels so important notifications are never missed. When an alert is generated, the system can notify relevant users through email, SMS, and clear dashboard pop-up messages. Each notification clearly communicates what happened, which parameter caused the alert, and its severity, ensuring users receive timely and reliable information from wherever they are.
## T-14: Technician Sensor Setup and Maintenance Access 
 Restricts technicians’ system access to sensor installation, configuration, and maintenance tasks, preventing exposure to administrative or analytical features.
## F-12:Implement water quality trend monitoring for officers and researchers
This feature provides trend monitoring of water quality parameters over time using visual charts. Environmental officers and researchers can analyze changes and patterns in water conditions. It helps in understanding long-term and short-term variations.
##F-7: Safe Limit Configuration
Admins and Environmental Officers can define acceptable threshold values for pH, temperature, and turbidity based on environmental standards. These limits are stored in the system and are used to evaluate incoming sensor data and trigger alerts when exceeded.
**Status:Implemented**
## F-2: Implement Login/Logout Page
This feature enables registered users to securely log in and log out of the system using their email and password. The system verifies credentials, prevents unauthorized access, and manages user sessions securely. Proper authentication ensures that users can only access features permitted by their selected role.
