# Implemented Features
## F-16: Implement Real-Time Automatic Alert Generation 
This feature allows the system to continuously track all critical parameters and automatically trigger alerts whenever any value crosses its predefined safe threshold. Users do not need to constantly monitor data manually because the system continuously watches all readings and immediately raises alerts whenever an abnormal or risky condition is detected. This ensures early warning, faster decision-making, and improved system safety.
